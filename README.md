  # NGO Dashboard UI Skeleton

  This is a code bundle for NGO Dashboard UI Skeleton. 
  🏛️ GlassBox45 — NGO Transparency & Donor Portal (Prototype)

GlassBox45 is a donor-facing transparency platform designed for NGOs.
It enables donors to contribute through money, in-kind items, or volunteer services, and helps them track how their contributions are being utilized — with full receipts, timelines, verification, and tax benefits.

The goal is simple:

Make charitable giving transparent, accountable, fast, and fraud-proof.

This prototype currently focuses on frontend UI + Supabase authentication.
